# weatherApp
Pleased to be acquainted with you. Note below the android assessment. Read carefully and you have 4 days to complete it. 

As a developer for an up and coming weather station, you are tasked to design and implement an Android application for the company. The requirements document they have sent can be found below.

Requirements: 

The implementation of the application is up to you with regards to UI/UX and project structure, however there are requirements that need to be met:

You must show a map view, in which you can pin a location on the map

Show a list of 5 or more days weather information based on the location selected

After selecting the list item generated above, you must show the details of the weather that are available for that particular day

The user should be able to decide to either see their temperature in Fahrenheit or Degrees Celsius

Bonus features:

Although the requirements that are mandatory are mentioned above, if the features are implemented in time and there is time to spare, there are a few extra features below which can be implemented that will get you bonus points with the Directors.

Allow the user to search for an address and select it on the search bar and then provide a pin on the map

After clicking on the map and receiving the lat long, use reverse geolocation to provide the address to the user for display

Add in icons for the different weather types (Sunny, partly cloudy, rainy, thunderstorms)

Visual is always a good way to get users to enjoy using an application.

NB:

An application that does not work or crashes will not work for the company, if the application is to be implemented, it must be stable.

Please may you provide a plan you have put in place in the form of a flow diagram or any other format you see fit to display how you best came up with the screen flow you have chosen.

Persistence:
Use datastore of your choice to persist the captured data (RealmDB / Room etc.)
Locations on the list should display the location name, as well as the Lat and Lng.

Great to have (But not a must ): 
Dagger2 for the dependency injection
ReactiveX (RxAndroid and RxJava)

Language:

Java/Kotlin

You have 4 days to complete this assessment, you must also use git version control to show you are committing regularly. You may use any git system you like, as long as we have access to it to assess your git commits as well as your code.

If you have any questions please feel free to ask. Thanks

kind regards,
